# Environmental-Monotoring
This project is an environmental monitoring system built using the Raspberry Pi Pico. It collects real-time data from sensors — including temperature, humidity, and air quality — to track environmental conditions. The system processes and displays the data, making it useful for applications like home automation, weather tracking, or smart agriculture.

✨ Features:

🌡️ Temperature & Humidity Monitoring
💨 Air Quality Detection
📊 Data Logging & Visualization
🔔 Alerts for Unhealthy Conditions

🚀 Tech Stack: Raspberry Pi Pico, MicroPython/C, Sensor Modules
